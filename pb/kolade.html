It was founded by Christian Obioma, popularly known as 'Mr Cherish Apple' alongside the Vice President, Mrs Evelyn Alaegbu. <p> CHEF has been in existence for years and is now looking to be recognized globally. CHEF‚Äôs mission is to provide teens with the tools and resources they need to become successful, responsible citizens. To achieve this goal, CHEF focuses on six key areas: teaching teens to affect their society positively, assisting teens in exercising leadership, raising young people with integrity, equipping youths to be godly influencers, supporting and defending deaf and dumb children, and sheltering street kids. </p> <p>CHEF‚Äôs first goal is to teach teens how they can positively affect their society. Through workshops and seminars, CHEF provides teens with the knowledge and skills they need to become active members of their communities. Teens learn how they can use their talents and abilities to make a difference in the world around them. </p> <p>CHEF‚Äôs second goal is to assist teens in exercising leadership. Through mentorship programs, CHEF helps teens develop the confidence and skills necessary for effective leadership. Teens learn how to take initiative, set goals, manage projects, and collaborate with others. </p> <p>CHEF‚Äôs third goal is to raise young people with integrity. Through character-building activities such as community service projects and ethical decision-making exercises, CHEF helps teens develop strong moral values that will guide them throughout their lives. </p> <p>CHEF‚Äôs fourth goal is to equip youths to be godly influencers. Through spiritual guidance programs such as Bible study groups and prayer meetings, CHEF helps teens develop a strong faith that will serve as a foundation for all of their future endeavors. </p> <p>CHEF‚Äôs fifth goal is to support and defend deaf and dumb children who are often overlooked by society. Through advocacy campaigns and fundraising initiatives, CHEF works hard to ensure that these children have access to the same opportunities as other children in their communities. </p> Finally, CHEF‚Äôs sixth goal is to shelter street kids who are often neglected by society due poverty or other circumstances beyond their control. Through its network of shelters across the country, CHEF provides these kids with food, clothing, medical care, education opportunities, job training programs, counseling services and most importantly a safe place where they can call home. Through its six core goals‚Äîteaching teens how they can positively affect their society; assisting teens in exercising leadership; raising young people with integrity; equipping youths to be godly influencers; supporting and defending deaf and dumb children; sheltering street kids, the Cherishapple Empowerment Foundation (CHEF) works hard every day towards its mission of empowering young people so that they can become successful citizens of tomorrow's world! <p>Overall, CHEF is dedicated to making a positive impact on the lives of young people around the world and relies on donations from generous individuals and organizations to continue its work. Every donation helps CHEF reach more teens and provide them with the tools they need to become successful leaders in their communities. As Mr Cherishapple said: ‚ÄúWe believe that every child deserves an opportunity for a better future‚Äù. Your donation can help make that future possible. Together, we can make a difference!</p> <p> CHEF is currently holding a writing contest, this is done monthly to acknowledge, honor, and equip writers.
